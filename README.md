# Xames 

Xames is a mobile app, that contains several logical games.
It is made by THE ERRORs.
The logical games are based on math, algorithms and logic from the distant past.
They are fascinating and cause desirability for understanding them on a deeper level.
Your aim is to find out the "always-winning" algorithm by learning how to use graphic methods, method of mathematical induction 
to prove unusual theorems.
The successful participation in a game should be well thought in advance.
There are some historical facts for each one of the games - when or where it appears, who found the "not-losing" algorithm, etc.

## Bachet Game

You can choose single player or multi player
If you choose multi player - you and your opponent should stand one versus another.
At each turn the player can take from one to five objects from the common group.
Each of you take turns and the goal is to make your opponent take the last object.
If he takes he last object, you are the winner! Woohoo!
